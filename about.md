## General Information

I'am a Ph.D student in the group of [**Andr√©-Marie Tremblay**](https://www.physique.usherbrooke.ca/pages/en/node/3412).
I study Condensed matter physics, and more particularly [**Quantum Monte Carlo**](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.83.349). 
My interets are mainly concerned with high performance computing using C++ / python and applying these to solve novel problems in strongly correlated many-body physics. I also use machine learning to improve the present algorithms, such as [**self learning Monte Carlo**](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.161102).
