## GitHub

My github repository can be found here [ZGCDDoo](https://github.com/ZGCDDoo).
The exciting projects are unfortunately private for academic and competitive reasons. Once my studies are finished, my Continuous time Quantum Monte Carlo Solvers will be made publicly available. A simple (non-parallel, not fully optimized) Quantum Monte Carlo code written in efficient C++ is freely available on my *Github*. Please feel free to contact me if you wish to obtain the more serious Quantum Monte Carlo solvers, I will consider adding you as a collaborator to the project.

## Python packages
My python packages can be found on *Github*. They are also installable via **pip**, the python package manager

 - [statsfiles](https://pypi.org/project/statsfiles/)
 - [isypy](https://pypi.org/project/isypy/)
 <!-- - [mea](https://pypi.org/project/mea/)  -->

 These projects were developped to be used as personal and group software, and unfortunately, the description and tutorials are not very advanced for now.


## Snap packages

snap packages are portable and self-contained linux packages. I have packaged the free continuous time Quantum Monte Carlo solver.
